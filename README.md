# Rationale:

the CLI will deploy/install/configure needed packages/files etc on Instance.

You need to copy the binary to your cloud/vms instance and execute it.

In the `server` you will run:

`tanzen init server`

on clients

`tanzen init client`

with the flags needed

# Build

`make`

# Usage:

one binary is builded `tanzen` will prompt you the help message
